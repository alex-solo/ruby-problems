# HTTP

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol (set of rules and guidelins) that is foundational to how machines communicate 
with each other and transfer hypertext. The role of HTTP is to establish a comunication between a client and a server. Also referred 
to as a "request/response protocol", a complete cycle involves a client, usually a web-browser making an HTTP request to the server and
the server sending back a response to that request. When visiting a simple webpage, the client makes an HTTP request to the server for
the necessary resources needed to load the page (HTML, images, etc.) and the server sends back an HTTP response with those resources.
